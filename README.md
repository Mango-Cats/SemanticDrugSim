Public GitHub repository for computing semantic drug similarity by unsupervised
learning using PubMed corpus and a fastText model.

This work has been accepted as a conference proceeding of the **28th International Conference of Oriental COCOSDA** and
will be presented on November 12â€“14, 2025, at Universitas Kristen Duta Wacana (UKDW), Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

## Supplementary Heatmaps

The conference proceeding references additional heatmaps not included in the paper.  
These supplementary materials are available in the [heatmaps/](/heatmaps) directory.

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Mango-Cats/SemanticDrugSim
```

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) for
package and project management. The provided `init.ps1` script handles setup:
it installs `uv` if necessary, creates a Python virtual environment, and adds
all dependencies. Simply run:

```pwsh
.\init.ps1
```

> What this does, is it checks if `uv` installed and downloads it if not. Then,
activate the Python virtual environments (venv) and adds all dependencies to it.

## Repository Structure

- `main.py` â€” entry point for running the project.
- `heatmaps/`
- `similarity/` â€” scripts for computing semantic and orthographic similarity.
- `train/` â€” scripts for training the fastText model.
- `visualize/` â€” scripts for creating heatmaps.
- `corpus/` â€” Go and PowerShell scripts for extracting and parsing the corpus.
- `vendor/` â€” fastText `.whl` file.
